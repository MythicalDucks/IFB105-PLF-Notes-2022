# Welcome!

## Howdy!

Seeming I was making my notes for this semester for tutorials this semester to further my knowledge, I thought it would be good to share. I'm hoping to eventually figure out how to make this a collaborative platform (which I'm pretty sure is possible) which people can add to/make suggestions so hopefully, it can stay up-to-date. Feel free to leave suggestions or just browse in the meantime :)
